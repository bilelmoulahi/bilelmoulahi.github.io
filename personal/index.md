title: Hobbies!
---

When I was younger, I wanted to spend my time in martial arts. One of my great hobbies was to practice Karat√© and Kick Boxing. When I started undergrad studies, I stopped practicing my favorite sport, but I keep playing football and sometimes I enjoy running. Since I moved to Montpellier, coming from Toulouse, I started swimming and surprisingly, I really love it! 

My other interests include reading. I spend most of the time reading things related to my research topics, and from time to times I also read about psychology and history.  
I'm not very active in blogs and places like Twitter and Linkedin, but given that I just created this Website, I will try to write about things I'm learning and doing whenever I have time.

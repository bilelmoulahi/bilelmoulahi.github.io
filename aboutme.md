##  Postdoctoral Researcher, ADVanced Analytics for data SciencE team, [LIRMM](http://www.lirmm.fr/)

Since September 2016, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Montpellier Laboratory of Informatics, Robotics and Microelectronics (LIRMM), Montpellier University, France. Actually, I'm a member of the ADVanced Analytics for data SciencE ([ADVANSE](https://www.lirmm.fr/recherche/equipes/advanse)) team under the direction of Prof. Jérôme Azé and Prof. Sandra Bringay. 

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Toulouse Paul Sabatier in December 2015, within the IRIS team at the [IRIT laboratory](http://www.irit.fr). I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Lynda Tamine and Prof. Sadok Ben Yahia. 
During my PhD, I have worked on multi-criteria relevance estimation and temporal information retrieval. In particular, my research focused on the definition and evaluation of information retrieval models for the combination of multidimensional relevance estimates in IR applications such as social search personalized and temporal IR. I have participated to many evaluation campaigns including TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) Contextual Suggestion track, TREC Temporal Summarization track, TREC Microblog track, SemEval (International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation) task and very recently, the TREC Real-Time Summarization Track. 
Prior to my PhD I have worked on social network analysis and data mining applications as part of my Master and BSc theses.

Currently, I'm working on suicide detection and prevention within social networks. The aim is the design and the implementation of new methods and technologies for the early identification of individuals at risk from massive data. This Postdoc is the result of a collaboration with the Psychiatric Emergencies and Post-Acute Care of Montpellier ([CHU de Montpellier](http://www.chu-montpellier.fr/)).  
We are currently working with 
As a result, the models, tools and techniques for the detection of suicidal profiles will be used by psychiatrists to follow patients on social networks, who have stayed in their services after a first suicide attempt.
